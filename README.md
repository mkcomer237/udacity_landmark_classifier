### Udacity Deep Learning Course - Landmark Classification Project

This implements both a CNN from scratch in pytorch, and a Transfer learning approach using Resnet34 to solve the 50 class landmark classfication problem.  Open the 'landmark' for details on the project and all the code to build the classifiers as well as examples of how to use it.  

To run the notebook and train the classifiers, download the [landmark dataset](https://udacity-dlnfd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/datasets/landmark_images.zip) referenced in the notebook.
